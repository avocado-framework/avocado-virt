Avocado Virt Plugin
===================

DISCLAIMER: this project is not being maintained, and this repository
is intended only for reference purposes.  Use it at your own risk.

This package ships with:

* A plugin for the avocado test runner to pass virt related options.
* A library for test writers to write virtualization related tests.

They are developed separately, in order to keep the core avocado tidy
and clean.
